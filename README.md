# Community Pro Post Types
The official custom post types for the Community Pro Genesis Child Theme by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/calvinmakes">Calvin Makes</a> and <a href="http:/www.twitter.com/avclark">Adam Clark</a>.

### Release Notes (v2.0)
Everything works the same as v1.1, with the exception that widgets have been decoupled from the plugin since they belong with the theme. This plugin will not work as intended unless you are running Community Pro Theme 2.0, which will be released shortly. If you have questions, email support@communityprotheme.com for help.

### Release Notes (v1.1)
Pull request to add better translation support and unify text-domains. **Please Note:** that if you already have custom taxonomies associated with this plugin, and you update, you may have to rebuild and assign your categories to their respective post types.


## Configuring Sermons
Sermons are a useful custom post type that allows you to fill in some details and have custom taxonomies for different series and/or categories.

1. Select **Sermons > Add New** from the WordPress Dashboard Menu.
2. Insert your Sermon Title
3. Add a description and/or transcript into the body content area.
4. On the right sidebar, navigate to the box that says **Sermon Details**.
5. Add in the **Speaker**, **Sermon Date**, and the **Souncloud URL** if your sermon is hosted on SoundCloud. Otherwise, leave it blank.
6. Configure the rest like a normal post or page in WordPress.
7. Click the **Publish** button.

### Configuring the Sermons Archive Settings
1. Navigate to **Sermons > Archive Settings**.
2. Add the desired **Archive Title** and **Archive Intro Text**.
3. Click the **Save Settings** button.

## Configuring Staff
The Staff page is a way to organize staff information for your organization or church.

1. Select **Staff > Add New** from the WordPress Dashboard Menu.
2. Insert the Name of the Staff Member into the **Title Bar**.
3. Add a tagline for the staff member in the **Subtitle Bar** or leave blank.
4. Insert the staff member bio into the **Content Area**, along with a picture (this is how it's done on the theme demo).
5. On the right sidebar, navigate to the box that says **Staff Categories**, and add or select the appropriate category for the staff member.
6. Set a featured image, usually the same as the staff member's picture you inserted into the **Content Area**. (This is required for the Staff page template).
7. Click the **Publish** button.

Now that you know how to create individual staff members, you'll need to add a link to the Staff page template. By default, this is set to the */staff* slug in your URL.
For instance, if my domain is www.communityprotheme.com, then the Staff page will be located at www.communityprotheme.com/staff.

### Add Staff Link to Menu
1. Navigate to **Appearance > Menu**.
2. In your appropriate navigation menu, click the **Links** bar in the left sidebar.
3. Enter **/staff** into the URL input box.
4. Enter **Staff** into the Link Title input box, or something similar.
5. Click the **Add to Menu** button.
6. Save your Menu.

You should now see the link on your navigation.

### Configuring the Staff Archive Settings
1. Navigate to **Staff > Archive Settings**.
2. Add the desired **Archive Title** and **Archive Intro Text**.
3. Click the **Save Settings** button.
